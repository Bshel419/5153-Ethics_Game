Game Abstract

Our game will be centered around teaching software engineers various topics in regard to the ethics of their field. Our game will consist of 4 levels and along with those levels, there will be 3 levels of difficulty(easy, medium, hard) associated with each level. Each level will consist of multiple questions and minigames dealing with software engineering ethics as the subject matter. To progress through the levels, the user must know and apply the ethics principle being featured correctly. We will be using the agile method for developing this game. 


Purpose

To create a fun game that will help educate players.

Scope

To create a game without advanced art assets and few levels to create a basis from which to expand upon with later projects. Utilizing Unity, a popular framework in the medium, this project should be easily expandable by other teams in the future.

Objective

This project will hopefully instill the knowledge of software engineering ethics onto the player so that the player can approach software engineering with an ethical mindset.
